The standards contained in the final Guidelines will be enforceable by the terms of a Federal statute that authorizes the OCC to prescribe operational and managerial standards for national banks and Federal savings associations. In addition, as part of our ongoing efforts to integrate the regulations of the OCC and those of the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), the OCC is adopting final rules and guidelines that make its safety and soundness standards regulations and guidelines applicable to both national banks and Federal savings associations and that remove the comparable Federal savings association regulations and guidelines. The OCC is also adopting other technical changes to the safety and soundness standards regulations and guidelines.",2014-09-11,"['Accounting', 'Administrative practice and procedure', 'Bank deposit insurance', 'Banks, banking', 'Banks, banking', 'Banks, banking', 'Banks, banking', 'Consumer protection', 'National banks', 'Privacy', 'Reporting and recordkeeping requirements', 'Savings associations', 'Security measures']"

2020-04776.xml,Financial Disclosures About Guarantors and Issuers of Guaranteed Securities and Affiliates Whose Securities Collateralize a Registrant's Securities,"The Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') is adopting amendments to the financial disclosure requirements for guarantors and issuers of guaranteed securities registered or being registered, and issuers' affiliates whose securities collateralize securities registered or being registered in Regulation S-X to improve those requirements for both investors and registrants. The changes are intended to provide investors with material information given the specific facts and circumstances, make the disclosures easier to understand, and reduce the costs and burdens to registrants. In addition, by reducing the costs and burdens of compliance, issuers may be encouraged to offer guaranteed or collateralized securities on a registered basis, thereby affording investors protection they may not be provided in offerings conducted on an unregistered basis. Finally, by making it less burdensome and less costly for issuers to include guarantees or pledges of affiliate securities as collateral when they structure debt offerings, the revisions may increase the number of registered offerings that include these credit enhancements, which could result in a lower cost of capital and an increased level of investor protection.",2020-04-20,"['Reporting and recordkeeping requirements', 'Securities']"

The proposals also would continue our long-term efforts toward integrating disclosure and processes under the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Our goal continues to be to encourage offerors and issuers in cross-border business combinations, and rights offerings by foreign private issuers, to permit U.S. security holders to participate in these transactions in the same manner as other holders. Many of the rule changes we propose today would codify existing interpretive positions and exemptive orders in the cross- border area. In several instances, we request comment about whether the rule changes we propose also should apply to tender offers for U.S. companies. In this release, we also address certain interpretive issues of concern for U.S. and other offerors engaged in cross-border business combinations.

The rules also specify how CEA and Exchange Act recordkeeping, reporting, and certain other rules will apply to security futures product transactions and accounts in which security futures products are held. These rules are adopted pursuant to the provisions of the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 (``CFMA'') that direct the Commissions to address certain duplicative or conflicting regulations applicable to any firm fully-registered both as an FCM and as a broker-dealer.

The DIMIA major assets prohibition prohibits a management official of a depository organization with total assets exceeding $2.5 billion (or any affiliate of such an organization) from serving at the same time as a management official of an unaffiliated depository organization with total assets exceeding $1.5 billion (or any affiliate of such an organization). DIMIA provides that the agencies may adjust, by regulation, the major assets prohibition thresholds in order to allow for inflation or market changes. The agencies propose to raise the major assets prohibition thresholds to $10 billion to account for changes in the United States banking market since the current thresholds were established in 1996. The agencies also propose three alternative approaches for increasing the thresholds based on market changes or inflation. Increasing the major assets prohibition thresholds would relieve certain depository organizations below the adjusted thresholds from having to ask the agencies for an exemption from the major assets prohibition. The agencies do not expect the proposal to materially increase anticompetitive risk.",2019-01-31,"['Administrative practice and procedure', 'Antitrust', 'Banks, banking', 'Banks, banking', 'Banks, banking', 'Banks, banking', 'Holding companies', 'National banks', 'Reporting and recordkeeping requirements', 'Securities']"

In addition, the Commission is seeking comment on other potential changes in our regulation of money market funds, including whether money market funds should, like other types of mutual funds, effect shareholder transactions at the market-based net asset value, i.e., whether they should have ``floating'' rather than stabilized net asset values.

Because compliance with the 2001 interim final rules has not been mandatory, withdrawal of these provisions from the Code of Federal Regulations reduces confusion about the status of the provisions and simplifies the regulation. In addition, the Board is adopting final amendments to Regulation M to provide guidance on the electronic delivery of disclosures.

Pursuant to the statute and proposed rules, an IBHC would be eligible to be an SIBHC if it is not affiliated with certain types of banks and has a substantial presence in the securities markets. The proposed rules would provide an IBHC with a process to become supervised by the Commission as an SIBHC, and would establish regulatory requirements for an SIBHC, including requirements regarding its group-wide internal risk management control system, recordkeeping, and periodic reporting (including reporting of consolidated computations of allowable capital and risk allowances consistent with the Basel Standards). The Commission is also proposing to add an exemption to the Commission's risk assessment rules to exempt a broker- dealer that is affiliated with an SIBHC because the SIBHC will be maintaining records and reporting to the Commission regarding the financial and operational condition of members of the affiliate group.

Accordingly, this interim rule amends Part 32 to make permanent the special limits set forth in the pilot program.

The Dodd-Frank Act provides that swaps in an agricultural commodity (as defined by the Commission) are prohibited unless entered into pursuant to a rule, regulation or order of the Commission adopted pursuant to Commodity Exchange Act (``CEA'' or ``Act''). The Dodd-Frank Act also includes options (other than an option on a futures contract) in its definition of swaps. Broadly speaking, the rules proposed herein would implement regulations whereby swaps in agricultural commodities and all commodity options (including options on both agricultural and non-agricultural commodities), other than options on futures, may transact subject to the same rules as all other swaps. The proposed rules for swaps in an agricultural commodity would repeal and replace the Commission's regulations concerning the exemption of swap agreements. Because the Dodd-Frank Act defines commodity options (other than options on futures) as swaps, the proposed rules for options would substantially amend the Commission's regulations regarding commodity option transactions. Also, current regulations on domestic exchange-traded commodity option transactions applies not only to exchange-traded options on futures (which are excluded from the Dodd-Frank definition of a swap), but also to exchange-traded options on physical commodities (which are within the Dodd-Frank swap definition). Therefore, the proposed rules would remove references to options on physical commodities from the Commission's regulations for exchange-traded options on futures.",2011-02-03,"['Administrative practice and procedure', 'Brokers', 'Commodity futures', 'Consumer protection', 'Fraud', 'Reporting and recordkeeping requirements']"

The purpose of this action was to reduce strains being experienced by money market mutual funds. To facilitate national bank participation in the program, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) adopted on September 19, 2008, on an interim final basis, an exemption from its risk-based capital guidelines for ABCP held by a national bank as a result of its participation in this program. The AMLF was set to expire on January 30, 2009. However, to encourage the stability of money market mutual funds, the program has been extended to October 30, 2009. This rule finalizes the risk-based capital exemption and extends the risk-based capital exemption to ABCP purchased beyond the original January 30, 2009, date. This final rule applies the risk-based capital exemption to any ABCP purchased as a result of a national bank's participation in the facility.

The proposals pertain to the governance, administration, transparency and ownership of self-regulatory organizations (``SROs'') that are national securities exchanges or registered securities associations and the periodic reporting of information by these SROs regarding their regulatory programs. The proposals also relate to the listing and trading by SROs of their own or affiliated securities. First, the proposals would impose new governance standards on national securities exchanges and registered securities associations by requiring a majority of the members of the exchange's or association's board of directors to be independent. In addition, key committees of the board would be required to be composed solely of independent directors. The proposals would define the term ``independent director.'' The proposals also would require exchanges and associations to establish policies and procedures to maintain a separation between their regulatory functions and their market operations and other commercial interests, and require that funds received from regulatory fines, fees, and penalties be used for regulatory purposes. Further, the proposals would require national securities exchanges and registered securities associations to prohibit any member that is a broker or dealer from owning and voting more than 20% of the ownership interest in the exchange or the association, or a facility of the exchange or association. To supplement these ownership and voting provisions, the proposals also would require each member of an exchange or association that is a broker or dealer to file a report with the Commission when the member acquires ownership of more than 5% of any interest in the exchange or association, or any facility thereof. Also, the Commission proposes to require national securities exchanges and national securities associations to maintain their books and records in the United States. Together, these proposals are designed to strengthen the governance and administration of SROs and address the possible concentration of ownership by member firms. In addition, the Commission proposes to amend its forms for registration as a national securities exchange or registered securities association to require that these SROs file with the Commission and publicly disclose enhanced information relating to their governance, regulatory programs, finances, ownership structure, and other matters. Further, the Commission's rules governing the procedures for filing amendments to these registration forms would be revised to require more frequent updating of the required information and the posting of the required information on the SROs' Internet Web sites. These proposals are designed to provide greater transparency to key aspects of the governance, ownership structure, and regulatory operations of national securities exchanges and registered securities associations. The Commission also proposes to require national securities exchanges and registered securities associations to file with the Commission, in an electronic format, quarterly and annual reports on particular aspects of their regulatory programs. This proposal is intended to enhance the Commission's oversight and surveillance of exchanges and associations by requiring them to provide the Commission with detailed regulatory information on a regular basis, thereby assisting the Commission to oversee more effectively the SROs' regulatory programs and better identify any trends or issues that may arise. Finally, the Commission proposes to impose requirements on a national securities exchange or registered securities association that chooses to list or trade its own security, the security of any trading facility, or the security of an affiliate of itself or a facility. The proposed requirements are designed to assure that these SROs are able to enforce effectively their listing standards with respect to, and supervise trading in, their own or a facility's securities, or the securities of affiliates of the SRO or a facility.",2004-12-08,"['Brokers', 'Reporting and recordkeeping requirements', 'Securities']"

The amendments would establish a temporary provision under Securities Act rules that, on a trial basis, would permit a non- reporting issuer to offer and sell securities for a compensatory purpose to an expanded group of workers without having to register the offers and sales under the Securities Act, as long as certain conditions are met. Specifically, the proposed amendments would permit the issuer to offer and sell securities to those workers who provide services available through the issuer's internet-based marketplace platform or through another widespread, technology-based marketplace platform or system (``platform workers''). The amendments would similarly, on a trial basis, permit a reporting issuer to include such workers in compensatory offerings registered on Form S-8. These proposed rule amendments would expire, absent further action by the Commission, five years from the date of their effectiveness. We are also proposing to amend the rules under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act''). The amendment would extend the exclusion from the definition of ``held of record'' and corresponding safe harbor, which currently applies to securities held by persons who received them pursuant to an employee compensation plan, to securities held by persons who received them pursuant to a compensation plan for platform workers under the proposed Securities Act rule amendment.

The amendments exclude from the accelerated and large accelerated filer definitions an issuer that is eligible to be a smaller reporting company and that had annual revenues of less than $100 million in the most recent fiscal year for which audited financial statements are available. The amendments also include a specific provision excluding business development companies from the accelerated and large accelerated filer definitions in analogous circumstances. In addition, the amendments increase the transition thresholds for accelerated and large accelerated filers becoming non- accelerated filers from $50 million to $60 million, and for exiting large accelerated filer status from $500 million to $560 million. Further, the amendments add a revenue test to the transition thresholds for exiting from both accelerated and large accelerated filer status. Finally, the amendments add a check box to the cover pages of Forms 10- K, 20-F, and 40-F to indicate whether an internal control over financial reporting (``ICFR'') auditor attestation is included in the filing.

The proposal is intended to assist the Commission in identifying and obtaining certain baseline trading information about traders that conduct a substantial amount of trading activity, as measured by volume or market value, in the U.S. securities markets. In essence, a ``large trader'' would be defined as a person whose transactions in NMS securities equal or exceed two million shares or $20 million during any calendar day, or 20 million shares or $200 million during any calendar month. The proposed large trader reporting system is designed to facilitate the Commission's ability to assess the impact of large trader activity on the securities markets, to reconstruct trading activity following periods of unusual market volatility, and to analyze significant market events for regulatory purposes. It also should enhance the Commission's ability to detect and deter fraudulent and manipulative activity and other trading abuses, and should provide the Commission with a valuable source of useful data to study markets and market activity. The proposed identification, recordkeeping, and reporting system would provide the Commission with a mechanism to identify large traders and their affiliates, accounts, and transactions. Specifically, proposed Rule 13h-1 would require large traders to identify themselves to the Commission and make certain disclosures to the Commission on proposed Form 13H. Upon receipt of Form 13H, the Commission would issue a unique identification number to the large trader, which the large trader would then provide to its registered broker-dealers. Registered broker-dealers would be required to maintain transaction records for each large trader, and would be required to report that information to the Commission upon request.

The two alternatives are designed to address money market funds' susceptibility to heavy redemptions, improve their ability to manage and mitigate potential contagion from such redemptions, and increase the transparency of their risks, while preserving, as much as possible, the benefits of money market funds. The first alternative proposal would require money market funds to sell and redeem shares based on the current market-based value of the securities in their underlying portfolios, rounded to the fourth decimal place (e.g., $1.0000), i.e., transact at a ``floating'' net asset value per share (``NAV''). The second alternative proposal would require money market funds to impose a liquidity fee (unless the fund's board determines that it is not in the best interest of the fund) if a fund's liquidity levels fell below a specified threshold and would permit the funds to suspend redemptions temporarily, i.e., to ``gate'' the fund under the same circumstances. Under this proposal, we could adopt either alternative by itself or a combination of the two alternatives. The SEC also is proposing additional amendments that are designed to make money market funds more resilient by increasing the diversification of their portfolios, enhancing their stress testing, and increasing transparency by requiring money market funds to provide additional information to the SEC and to investors.

The Commission is proposing these amendments in light of the rules recently adopted by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (``Board''), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (``FDIC''), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (``OCC'') (collectively, the ``QFC Rules'') that impose restrictions on certain uncleared swaps and uncleared security-based swaps and other financial contracts. Specifically, the Commission proposes to amend the definition of ``eligible master netting agreement'' in the CFTC Margin Rule to ensure that master netting agreements of firms subject to the CFTC Margin Rule are not excluded from the definition of ``eligible master netting agreement'' based solely on such agreements' compliance with the QFC Rules. The Commission also proposes that any legacy uncleared swap (i.e., an uncleared swap entered into before the applicable compliance date of the CFTC Margin Rule) that is not now subject to the margin requirements of the CFTC Margin Rule would not become so subject if it is amended solely to comply with the QFC Rules. These proposed amendments are consistent with proposed amendments that the Board, FDIC, OCC, the Farm Credit Administration (``FCA''), and the Federal Housing Finance Agency (``FHFA'' and, together with the Board, FDIC, OCC, and FCA, the ``Prudential Regulators''), jointly published in the Federal Register on February 21, 2018.",2018-05-23,['Swaps']

These IDI personnel would include any employee with authority to open deposit accounts and/ or respond to customer questions about FDIC insurance coverage (hereafter ``employees''). Second, the proposed rule would require IDIs to implement procedures so that employees, when opening a new deposit account, inquire whether the customer has an ownership interest in any other account at the IDI and, if so, whether the customer's aggregate ownership interest in deposit accounts, including the new account, exceeds the Standard Maximum Deposit Insurance Amount (``SMDIA''). If this is the case, then the IDI employee would be required to provide the customer with a copy of the FDIC's publication, Deposit Insurance Summary.

The Commission believes it is critical that broker-dealers, which under the current regulatory structure are the only entities that may be members of exchanges and, as a practical matter, constitute the majority of subscribers to ATSs, appropriately control the risks associated with market access, so as not to jeopardize their own financial condition, that of other market participants, the integrity of trading on the securities markets, and the stability of the financial system.",2010-01-26,"['Brokers', 'Reporting and recordkeeping requirements', 'Securities']"

In this regard, the Commission proposes to amend certain of the regulations proposed in 2013 regarding exemptions from federal position limits and exchange-set position limits to take into account these new alternative processes. In connection with these changes, the Commission proposes to further amend certain relevant definitions, including to clearly define the general definition of bona fide hedging for physical commodities under the standards in CEA section 4a(c).

As proposed, this standard is consistent with alternative creditworthiness standards proposed by other Federal agencies under the Dodd-Frank Act and existing guidance regarding securities investments and credit classifications of banks and savings associations.

2020-25871.xml,Consumer Leasing (Regulation M),"The Board and the Bureau are finalizing amendments to the official interpretations and commentary for the agencies' regulations that implement the Consumer Leasing Act (CLA). The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) amended the CLA by requiring that the dollar threshold for exempt consumer leases be adjusted annually by the annual percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). If there is no annual percentage increase in the CPI-W, the Board and the Bureau will not adjust this exemption threshold from the prior year. However, in years following a year in which the exemption threshold was not adjusted, the threshold is calculated by applying the annual percentage change in the CPI-W to the dollar amount that would have resulted, after rounding, if the decreases and any subsequent increases in the CPI-W had been taken into account. Based on the annual percentage increase in the CPI-W as of June 1, 2020, the exemption threshold will remain at $58,300 effective January 1, 2021. Because the Dodd-Frank Act also requires similar adjustments in the Truth in Lending Act's threshold for exempt consumer credit transactions, the Board and the Bureau are making similar amendments to each of their respective regulations implementing the Truth in Lending Act elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register.",2020-12-10,"['Administrative practice and procedure', 'Advertising', 'Consumer protection', 'Federal Reserve System', 'Reporting and recordkeeping requirements', 'Truth in lending']"

Ratings changes will become effective when the rating change is transmitted to the institution. Although the FDIC will retain the existing assessment base as applied in practice with only minor modifications, the computation of institutions' assessment bases will change in the following significant ways: institutions with $1 billion or more in assets will determine their assessment bases using average daily deposit balances; existing smaller institutions will have the option of using average daily deposits to determine their assessment bases; and the float deductions used to determine the assessment base will be eliminated. In addition, the rules governing assessments of institutions that go out of business will be simpler; newly insured institutions will be assessed for the assessment period in which they become insured; prepayment and double payment options will be eliminated; institutions will have 90 days from each quarterly certified statement invoice to file requests for review of their risk assignment and requests for revision of the computation of their quarterly assessment payment; and the rules governing quarterly certified statement invoices will be adjusted for a quarterly assessment system and for a three-year retention period rather than the former five-year period.",2006-11-30,"['Bank deposit insurance', 'Banks, banking', 'Banks, banking', 'Banks, banking', 'Banks, banking', 'Savings associations']"

E9-8730.xml,Amendments to Regulation SHO,"The Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') is proposing amendments to Regulation SHO under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act''). We are proposing two approaches to restrictions on short selling--one is a price test that would apply on a market wide and permanent basis (``short sale price test'' or ``short sale price test restriction'') and one that would apply only to a particular security during severe market declines in that security (``circuit breaker''). With respect to the first approach, we propose two alternative short sale price tests: One based on the national best bid and the second based on the last sale price. With respect to the second approach, we propose two basic alternatives: One alternative is a circuit breaker rule that would temporarily prohibit short selling in a particular security when there is a severe decline in the price of that security (a ``halt''), which could operate in place of, or in addition to, a short sale price test rule; and the second alternative is a circuit breaker rule that would trigger a short sale price test rule; we propose that such a short sale price test either be based on the national best bid for any security for which there has been a severe price decline or be based on the last sale price for any security for which there has been a severe price decline. Due to the extreme market conditions that we are currently facing and the resulting deterioration in investor confidence, we believe it is appropriate at this time to re-evaluate and seek comment on some form of short sale price test restriction, either in the form of a short sale price test such as the proposed modified uptick rule or proposed uptick rule, or a circuit breaker rule. For each of the proposed short sale price test restrictions and proposed circuit breaker rules, we are also proposing to amend Regulation SHO to require that a broker-dealer mark certain sell orders ``short exempt.'' If the Commission adopts a short sale price test proposal or a circuit breaker proposal, and adopts a ``short exempt'' marking requirement, we are proposing that the implementation period for these amendments would be three months from the effective date of the amendments.",2009-04-20,[]

Proposed Rule 901(a)(2)(i) of Regulation SBSR would require a registered clearing agency to report to a registered SDR any security-based swap to which it is a counterparty. The Commission also is proposing certain conforming changes to other provisions of Regulation SBSR in light the proposed amendments to Rule 901(a), and a new rule that would prohibit registered SDRs from charging fees for or imposing usage restrictions on the users of the security-based swap transaction data that they are required to publicly disseminate. In addition, the Commission is explaining the application of Regulation SBSR to prime brokerage transactions and proposing guidance for the reporting and public dissemination of allocations of cleared security-based swaps.

The Rule defines the conditions for safe harbor protection for securitizations and participations for which transfers of financial assets are made after the transition period; and clarifies the application of the safe harbor to transactions that comply with the new accounting standards for off balance sheet treatment as well as those that do not comply with those accounting standards. The conditions contained in the Rule will serve to protect the Deposit Insurance Fund (``DIF'') and the FDIC's interests as deposit insurer and receiver by aligning the conditions for the safe harbor with better and more sustainable securitization practices by insured depository institutions (``IDIs'').",2010-09-30,"['Bank deposit insurance', 'Banks, banking', 'Banks, banking', 'Banks, banking', 'Banks, banking', 'Holding companies', 'National banks', 'Reporting and recordkeeping requirements', 'Savings associations']"

The proposed revisions would apply four protections to a newly-defined category of higher-priced mortgage loans secured by a consumer's principal dwelling, including a prohibition on a pattern or practice of lending based on the collateral without regard to consumers' ability to repay their obligations from income, or from other sources besides the collateral. The proposed revisions would apply three new protections to mortgage loans secured by a consumer's principal dwelling regardless of loan price, including a prohibition on a creditor paying a mortgage broker more than the consumer had agreed the broker would receive. The Board also proposes to require that advertisements provide accurate and balanced information, in a clear and conspicuous manner, about rates, monthly payments, and other loan features; and to ban several deceptive or misleading advertising practices, including representations that a rate or payment is ``fixed'' when it can change.

The deliberations and conclusions of the ISB contributed significantly to the development of the Commission's new auditor independence regulations and disclosure requirements, which were adopted in November 2000. In light of the Commission's new auditor independence rules, the Commission believes that many of the issues that led to the creation of the ISB have been resolved, and that going forward the best method to assure the independence of auditors is for the Commission and its staff to enforce and interpret its new rules. In addition, the Commission notes the recent increase in public participation on the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' (``AICPA'') Professional Ethics Executive Committee (``PEEC'') and encourages greater public membership on PEEC. The Commission staff, when appropriate, may work with the PEEC on discrete auditor independence issues. Standards previously adopted by the ISB and interpretations previously issued by the ISB will continue to be authoritative to the extent they do not conflict with the Commission's rules and interpretations. In making this amendment to FRR 50, the Commission reaffirms that maintaining the independence of auditors is crucial to the credibility of financial reporting and, in turn, the capital formation process.",2001-07-23,[]

Restricted securities of companies that are not subject to the Exchange Act reporting requirements would continue to be subject to a one-year holding period prior to any public resale. We also propose to substantially reduce the restrictions on the resale of securities by non-affiliates. In addition, we propose to simplify the Preliminary Note to Rule 144, eliminate the manner of sale restrictions with respect to debt securities, increase the Form 144 filing thresholds, and codify several staff interpretive positions that relate to Rule 144.

The statute generally provides that an insured depository institution which fails or refuses to pay any assessment shall be subject to a penalty of not more than 1 percent of the assessment due for each day the violation continues. The statute includes an exception if the failure to pay results from a dispute with the FDIC over the amount of the assessment and the institution deposits satisfactory security with the FDIC. The statute includes a provision covering assessment amounts of less than $10,000, which authorizes penalties up to $100 per day. Finally, the statute accords the FDIC discretion to compromise, modify or remit any penalty imposed on a finding that good cause prevented timely payment. The final rule amends the FDIC's former rule concerning late assessment penalties, in conformity with these provisions of the Reform Act.",2006-11-09,"['Administrative practice and procedure', 'Bank deposit insurance', 'Banks, banking', 'Banks, banking', 'Banks, banking', 'Banks, banking', 'Claims', 'Crime', 'Equal access to justice', 'Fraud', 'Investigations', 'Lawyers', 'Penalties']"

The Commission currently receives, and uses for market surveillance purposes, including position limit enforcement, data on large positions in all physical commodity futures and option contracts traded on DCMs. However, there is no analogous reporting structure in place for economically equivalent swaps, which until recently were largely unregulated financial contracts. The Commission's proposal would require position reports on economically equivalent swaps from clearing organizations, their members and swap dealers. Notably, the proposed regulations also include a sunset provision.

Under the proposed rule, the FDIC would amend the methodology for calculating the national rate and national rate cap for specific deposit products. The national rate would be the weighted average of rates paid by all insured depository institutions on a given deposit product, for which data are available, where the weights are each institution's market share of domestic deposits. The national rate cap for particular products would be set at the higher of the 95th percentile of rates paid by insured depository institutions weighted by each institution's share of total domestic deposits, or the proposed national rate plus 75 basis points. The proposed rule would also greatly simplify the current local rate cap calculation and process by allowing less than well capitalized institutions to offer up to 90 percent of the highest rate paid on a particular deposit product in the institution's local market area.",2019-09-04,"['Banks, banking', 'Banks, banking', 'Banks, banking', 'Banks, banking', 'Reporting and recordkeeping requirements', 'Savings associations', 'Securities']"

The surcharges would begin the calendar quarter after the reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF or fund) first reaches or exceeds 1.15 percent--the same time that lower regular deposit insurance assessment (regular assessment) rates take effect-- and would continue through the quarter that the reserve ratio first reaches or exceeds 1.35 percent. The surcharge would equal an annual rate of 4.5 basis points applied to the institution's assessment base (with certain adjustments). The FDIC expects that these surcharges will commence in 2016 and that they should be sufficient to raise the reserve ratio to 1.35 percent in approximately eight quarters, i.e., before the end of 2018. If, contrary to the FDIC's expectations, the reserve ratio does not reach 1.35 percent by December 31, 2018 (provided it is at least 1.15 percent), the FDIC would impose a shortfall assessment on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more on March 31, 2019. Since the Dodd-Frank Act requires that the FDIC offset the effect of the increase in the reserve ratio from 1.15 percent to 1.35 percent on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion, the FDIC would provide assessment credits to insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion for the portion of their regular assessments that contributed to growth in the reserve ratio between 1.15 percent and 1.35 percent.

The Agencies are proposing these amendments in light of the rules recently adopted by the Board, the OCC, and the FDIC that impose restrictions on certain non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps and other financial contracts (Covered QFCs) (the QFC Rules). The QFC Rules amend the definition of ``Qualifying Master Netting Agreement'' in the Federal banking agencies' regulatory capital and liquidity rules to ensure that a Covered QFC is not prevented from being part of a Qualifying Master Netting Agreement solely because the Covered QFC conforms to the new requirements in the QFC Rules. The FCA also plans to propose amendments to its capital rules, including potential revisions to its regulatory definition of ``Qualifying Master Netter Agreement,'' which is expected to be identical to the definition used in the Federal banking agencies' regulatory capital and liquidity rules. The Agencies are proposing to amend the definition of ``Eligible Master Netting Agreement'' in the Swap Margin Rule so that it remains harmonized with the amended definition of ``Qualifying Master Netting Agreement'' in the Federal banking agencies' regulatory capital and liquidity rules, and amendments to the capital rules that the FCA separately plans to propose. This proposed rule would also ensure that netting agreements of firms subject to the Swap Margin Rule are not excluded from the definition of ``Eligible Master Netting Agreement'' based solely on their compliance with the QFC Rules. The Agencies are also proposing that any legacy non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap (i.e., a non-cleared swap or non-cleared security- based swap entered into before the applicable compliance date) that is not subject to the margin requirements of the Swap Margin Rule would not become subject to the provisions of the Swap Margin Rule if the non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap is amended solely to comply with the requirements of the QFC Rules.",2018-02-21,[]

NFA petitioned the Commission to adopt this amendment after its implementation of a pilot program for electronic filing of commodity pool annual reports in 2005. The amendment necessarily eliminates the requirement that the commodity pool annual report filed with NFA be manually signed, and replaces it with a requirement that CPOs maintain for five years in their own business records a manually signed oath or affirmation with respect to each annual report along with documentation supporting the compilation of certain key financial balances required to be submitted to NFA. In addition to mandating electronic filing, the Commission is also amending other provisions of its rules applicable to CPOs with respect to financial reporting to: (i) Explicitly state that commodity pool monthly and/or quarterly account statements distributed to participants must be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; (ii) clarify that CPOs must file a notification of a change in a public accountant for a commodity pool with NFA; (iii) clarify that a reference to ``segregation'' with respect to a statement required to be made in an accountant's letter refers to the prohibition on commingling of funds of a commodity pool with the assets of any other person; and (iv) require that notifications concerning CPOs' election of fiscal years for commodity pools other than the calendar year or changes in fiscal year be filed solely with NFA and not the Commission. These amendments with respect to commodity pool financial reporting do not impact the distribution of annual reports to pool participants, which may continue to be provided through hard-copy distribution via postal mail or electronically if the pool participant consents thereto. Also, these amendments do not change the requirements or process for CPOs to request that the Commission provide confidential treatment to commodity pool annual reports submitted to NFA, in response to requests from the public made under the Freedom of Information Act.",2006-02-22,"['Advertising', 'Commodity futures', 'Consumer protection', 'Reporting and recordkeeping requirements']"

E6-21143.xml,Large-Bank Deposit Insurance Determination Modernization Proposal,"The FDIC is seeking comment on whether and how the largest insured depository institutions should be required to modify their deposit account systems to speed depositor access to funds in the event of a failure. Today, insured institutions do not track the insured status of their depositors yet the FDIC must make deposit insurance coverage determinations in the event of failure. The current process might result in unacceptable delays if used for an FDIC-insured institution with a large volume of deposit accounts. Such delays would have an impact on depositors' ability to access their funds and are likely to result in a resolution (of the failed institution) significantly more costly to the Deposit Insurance Fund. As currently contemplated, the options discussed in the ANPR would apply only to the 152 insured depository institutions with more than 250,000 deposit accounts and more than $2 billion in domestic deposits, as well as seven additional institutions with total assets over $20 billion, less than 250,000 deposit accounts and at least $2 billion in domestic deposits.

The proposal would apply to any U.S. top-tier bank holding company (BHC) with at least $700 billion in total consolidated assets or at least $10 trillion in assets under custody (covered BHC) and any insured depository institution (IDI) subsidiary of these BHCs. In the revised capital approaches adopted by the agencies in July, 2013 (2013 revised capital approaches), the agencies established a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of 3 percent (supplementary leverage ratio), consistent with the minimum leverage ratio adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), for banking organizations subject to the advanced approaches risk-based capital rules. In this notice of proposed rulemaking (proposal or proposed rule), the agencies are proposing to establish a ``well capitalized'' threshold of 6 percent for the supplementary leverage ratio for any IDI that is a subsidiary of a covered BHC, under the agencies' prompt corrective action (PCA) framework. The Board also proposes to establish a new leverage buffer for covered BHCs above the minimum supplementary leverage ratio requirement of 3 percent (leverage buffer). The leverage buffer would function like the capital conservation buffer for the risk-based capital ratios in the 2013 revised capital approaches. A covered BHC that maintains a leverage buffer of tier 1 capital in an amount greater than 2 percent of its total leverage exposure would not be subject to limitations on distributions and discretionary bonus payments. The proposal would take effect beginning on January 1, 2018.

The Bureau understands that the COVID-19 pandemic could pose temporary business disruptions and challenges for covered persons that are involved in the mortgage origination process, including creditors, loan originators, settlement agents, and other parties such as real estate appraisers. The Bureau recognizes, furthermore, that consumers may have acute needs for proceeds from mortgage transactions as well as uncertainty and confusion about the origination process.

The Bureau concludes in this interpretive rule that if a consumer determines that his or her need to obtain funds due to the COVID-19 pandemic (1) necessitates consummating the credit transaction before the end of the TRID Rule waiting periods or (2) must be met before the end of the Regulation Z Rescission Rules waiting period, then the consumer has a bona fide personal financial emergency that would permit the consumer to utilize the modification and waiver provisions, subject to the applicable procedures set forth in the TRID Rule and Regulation Z Rescission Rules. The Bureau also concludes in this interpretive rule that the COVID-19 pandemic is a ``changed circumstance'' for purposes of certain TRID Rule provisions, allowing creditors to use revised estimates reflecting changes in settlement charges for purposes of determining good faith.

Correct certified statements will no longer be signed by insured institutions or returned to the FDIC, and the semiannual certified statement process will be synchronized with the quarterly invoice process. Two quarterly certified statement invoices will comprise the semiannual certified statement and reflect the semiannual assessment amount. If an insured institution agrees with its quarterly certified statement invoice, it will simply pay the assessed amount and retain the invoice in its own files. If it disagrees with the quarterly certified statement invoice, it will either amend its report of condition or similar report (to correct data errors) or amend its quarterly certified statement invoice (to correct calculation errors). The FDIC will automatically treat either as the insured institution's request for revision of its assessment computation, eliminating the requirement of a separate filing. In addition, the FDIC will provide e- mail notification each quarter to let depository institutions know when their quarterly certified statement invoices are available on FDICconnect. An institution that lacks Internet access will be able request from the FDIC a one-year renewable exemption from the use of FDICconnect, during which it will continue to receive quarterly certified statement invoices by mail.

The proposed rules also include a modernized approach to securities registration fee payment that would require closed-end investment companies that operate as ``interval funds'' to pay securities registration fees using the same method that mutual funds use today.

The disclosure framework would feature concise and visually engaging shareholder reports that would highlight key information that is particularly important for retail investors to assess and monitor their fund investments.

Funds' shareholder reports would serve as the central source of fund disclosure for existing shareholders. Thus, instead of delivering prospectus updates to existing shareholders each year, open-end funds would have an alternative way to keep shareholders informed. This framework would rely on the shareholder report (which would include a summary of material fund changes), along with timely notifications to shareholders about material fund changes as they occur and continued availability of the fund's prospectus.

Regulation Best Interest enhances the broker-dealer standard of conduct beyond existing suitability obligations, and aligns the standard of conduct with retail customers' reasonable expectations by requiring broker-dealers, among other things, to: Act in the best interest of the retail customer at the time the recommendation is made, without placing the financial or other interest of the broker-dealer ahead of the interests of the retail customer; and address conflicts of interest by establishing, maintaining, and enforcing policies and procedures reasonably designed to identify and fully and fairly disclose material facts about conflicts of interest, and in instances where we have determined that disclosure is insufficient to reasonably address the conflict, to mitigate or, in certain instances, eliminate the conflict. The standard of conduct established by Regulation Best Interest cannot be satisfied through disclosure alone. The standard of conduct draws from key principles underlying fiduciary obligations, including those that apply to investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (``Advisers Act''). Importantly, regardless of whether a retail investor chooses a broker-dealer or an investment adviser (or both), the retail investor will be entitled to a recommendation (from a broker-dealer) or advice (from an investment adviser) that is in the best interest of the retail investor and that does not place the interests of the firm or the financial professional ahead of the interests of the retail investor.",2019-07-12,"['Brokers', 'Reporting and recordkeeping requirements', 'Securities']"

The proposed framework would require a U.S. top-tier bank holding company with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets to calculate a measure of its systemic importance and would identify a subset of those companies as global systemically important bank holding companies based on that measure. A global systemically important bank holding company would be subject to a risk-based capital surcharge that would increase its capital conservation buffer under the Board's regulatory capital rule.

The proposed amendments implement the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) provisions regarding mortgage loan servicing. Specifically, this proposal requests comment regarding proposed additions to Regulation X to address seven servicer obligations: To correct errors asserted by mortgage loan borrowers; to provide information requested by mortgage loan borrowers; to ensure that a reasonable basis exists to obtain force-placed insurance; to establish reasonable information management policies and procedures; to provide information about mortgage loss mitigation options to delinquent borrowers; to provide delinquent borrowers access to servicer personnel with continuity of contact about the borrower's mortgage loan account; and to evaluate borrowers' applications for available loss mitigation options. This proposal would also modify and streamline certain existing servicing-related provisions of Regulation X. For instance, the proposal would revise provisions relating to a mortgage servicer's obligation to provide disclosures to borrowers in connection with a transfer of mortgage servicing, and a mortgage servicer's obligation to manage escrow accounts, including the obligation to advance funds to an escrow account to maintain insurance coverage and to return amounts in an escrow account to a borrower upon payment in full of a mortgage loan. Published elsewhere in today's Federal Register, the Bureau proposes companion regulations implementing amendments to the Truth In Lending Act (TILA) in Regulation Z (the 2012 TILA Servicing Proposal).",2012-09-17,"['Condominiums', 'Consumer protection', 'Housing', 'Insurance', 'Mortgages', 'Reporting and recordkeeping requirements']"

Public Law 108-159, 117 Stat. 1952. The FACT Act substantially amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA or Act), 15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq. Section 411(a) of the FACT Act adds a new section 603(g)(1) to the FCRA to restrict the circumstances under which consumer reporting agencies may furnish consumer reports that contain medical information about consumers. Section 411(a) of the FACT Act also adds a new section 604(g)(2) to the FCRA to prohibit creditors from obtaining or using medical information pertaining to a consumer in connection with any determination of the consumer's eligibility, or continued eligibility, for credit. The Agencies are required to prescribe regulations that permit creditors to obtain or use medical information for eligibility purposes where necessary and appropriate to protect legitimate operational, transactional, risk, consumer, and other needs, consistent with the Congressional intent to restrict the use of medical information for inappropriate purposes. In addition, section 411(b) of the FACT Act adds a new section 603(d)(3) to the FCRA to restrict the sharing of medical information and related lists or descriptions with affiliates. Specifically, section 603(d)(3) provides that the standard exclusions from the definition of ``consumer report'' contained in section 603(d)(2)--such as sharing transaction or experience information about a consumer among affiliates or sharing other information among affiliates after providing the consumer notice and an opportunity to opt-out--do not apply if medical-related information is disclosed to an affiliate. Medical-related information includes medical information, an individualized list or description based on payment transactions for medical products or services, or an aggregate list of identified consumers based on payment transactions for medical products or services. The provisions of section 603(d)(3) do not apply if the sharing falls within certain exceptions, such as in connection with the business of insurance or annuities or for any purpose described in section 502(e) of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLB Act), Public Law 106- 102. Section 411(b) authorizes the Agencies to promulgate additional exceptions by regulation or order, as determined by the Agencies to be appropriate or necessary. The Agencies generally provide a 60-day period for the public to comment on the burdens associated with proposed rules.

Under the current rules, a foreign private issuer may find it difficult to terminate its Exchange Act registration and reporting obligations despite the fact that there is relatively little interest in the issuer's securities among United States investors. Moreover, currently a foreign private issuer can only suspend, and cannot permanently terminate, a duty to report arising under section 15(d). The proposed rules would permit the termination of Exchange Act reporting regarding a class of equity securities under either section 12(g) or section 15(d) by a foreign private issuer that meets specified criteria designed to measure U.S. market interest for that class of securities. The proposed rules would also permit a foreign private issuer to terminate, and not merely suspend, its section 15(d) reporting obligations regarding a class of debt securities as long as it meets conditions similar to the current requirements for suspending its reporting obligations relating to that class of debt securities.

The final rules recognize the critical role played by audit committees in the financial reporting process and the unique position of audit committees in assuring auditor independence. Consistent with the direction of Section 208(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are adopting rules to: revise the Commission's regulations related to the non-audit services that, if provided to an audit client, would impair an accounting firm's independence; require that an issuer's audit committee pre-approve all audit and non-audit services provided to the issuer by the auditor of an issuer's financial statements; prohibit certain partners on the audit engagement team from providing audit services to the issuer for more than five or seven consecutive years, depending on the partner's involvement in the audit, except that certain small accounting firms may be exempted from this requirement; prohibit an accounting firm from auditing an issuer's financial statements if certain members of management of that issuer had been members of the accounting firm's audit engagement team within the one-year period preceding the commencement of audit procedures; require that the auditor of an issuer's financial statements report certain matters to the issuer's audit committee, including ``critical'' accounting policies used by the issuer; and require disclosures to investors of information related to audit and non-audit services provided by, and fees paid to, the auditor of the issuer's financial statements. In addition, under the final rules, an accountant would not be independent from an audit client if an audit partner received compensation based on selling engagements to that client for services other than audit, review and attest services. As described further in the release, these rules also will have an impact on foreign accounting firms that conduct audits of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates of U.S. issuers, as well as of foreign private issuers. Many of the modifications to the proposed rules, such as those limiting the scope of partner rotation and personnel subject to the ``cooling off period,'' have the added benefit of addressing particular concerns raised about the international implications of these requirements. Moreover, additional time is being afforded to foreign accounting firms with respect to compliance with rotation requirements. The release also provides guidance on the provision of non-audit services by foreign accounting firms, including the treatment of legal services and tax services.",2003-02-05,"['Accountants', 'Accounting', 'Brokers', 'Investment companies', 'Reporting and recordkeeping requirements', 'Securities']"

The final rule applies four protections to a newly-defined category of higher-priced mortgage loans secured by a consumer's principal dwelling, including a prohibition on lending based on the collateral without regard to consumers' ability to repay their obligations from income, or from other sources besides the collateral. The revisions apply two new protections to mortgage loans secured by a consumer's principal dwelling regardless of loan price, including a prohibition on abusive servicing practices. The Board is also finalizing rules requiring that advertisements provide accurate and balanced information, in a clear and conspicuous manner, about rates, monthly payments, and other loan features. The advertising rules ban several deceptive or misleading advertising practices, including representations that a rate or payment is ``fixed'' when it can change.

Specifically, the proposed rule would revise the treatment of on- and off-balance sheet exposures for purposes of determining total leverage exposure, and more closely align the agencies' rules on the calculation of total leverage exposure with international leverage ratio standards. The proposed rule would incorporate in total leverage exposure the effective notional principal amount of credit derivatives and other similar instruments through which a banking organization provides credit protection (sold credit protection), modify the calculation of total leverage exposure for derivatives and repo-style transactions, and revise the credit conversion factors (CCFs) applied to certain off- balance sheet exposures. The proposed rule also would make changes to the methodology for calculating the supplementary leverage ratio and to the public disclosure requirements for the supplementary leverage ratio. The proposed rule would apply to all banks, savings associations, bank holding companies, and savings and loan holding companies (banking organizations) that are subject to the agencies' advanced approaches risk-based capital rules (advanced approaches banking organizations), as defined in the 2013 revised capital rule, including advanced approaches banking organizations that are subject to the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio standards that the agencies have adopted in final form and published elsewhere in today's Federal Register (the eSLR standards).

A broker-dealer using the alternative method of computing net capital is subject to enhanced net capital, early warning, recordkeeping, reporting, and certain other requirements, and must implement and document an internal risk management system. Furthermore, as a condition to its use of the alternative method, a broker-dealer's ultimate holding company and affiliates (referred to collectively as a consolidated supervised entity, or ``CSE'') must consent to group-wide Commission supervision. This supervision would impose reporting (including reporting of a capital adequacy measurement consistent with the standards adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision), recordkeeping, and notification requirements on the ultimate holding company.

E8-29123.xml,Truth in Lending,"On July 30, 2008, the Board published a final rule amending Regulation Z, which implements the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) and the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act (HOEPA). The July 2008 final rule requires creditors to give consumers transaction-specific cost disclosures shortly after application for closed-end loans secured by a consumer's principal dwelling. The disclosures must be provided before the consumer pays any fee, other than a fee for obtaining the consumer's credit history. Also on July 30, 2008, the Congress enacted the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, which included amendments to TILA, known as the Mortgage Disclosure Improvement Act of 2008 (MDIA). On October 3, 2008, the Congress amended the MDIA in connection with its enactment of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (``Stabilization Act''). The Board is now proposing revisions to Regulation Z to implement the provisions of the MDIA, as amended. The MDIA broadens and adds to the requirements of the Board's July 2008 final rule. Among other things, the MDIA requires early, transaction-specific disclosures for mortgage loans secured by dwellings other than the consumer's principal dwelling and requires waiting periods between the time when disclosures are given and consummation of the transaction. Moreover, these requirements of the MDIA will become effective on July 30, 2009, about two months earlier than the Board's regulatory amendments adopted in the July 2008 final rule. Consistent with the MDIA, the proposed amendments to Regulation Z would require creditors to deliver good faith estimates of the required mortgage disclosures or place them in the mail no later than three business days after receiving a consumer's application for a dwelling- secured closed-end loan. The delivery or mailing of these disclosures would have to occur at least seven business days before consummation. If the annual percentage rate provided in the good faith estimates changes beyond a stated tolerance, creditors must provide corrected disclosures, which the consumer must receive at least three business days before consummation of the transaction. The proposal would allow consumers to expedite consummation to meet a bona fide personal financial emergency. The MDIA, as amended by the Stabilization Act, specifies different requirements for providing early disclosures for mortgage transactions secured by a consumer's interest in a timeshare plan.",2008-12-10,"['Advertising', 'Consumer protection', 'Federal Reserve System', 'Mortgages', 'Reporting and recordkeeping requirements', 'Truth in lending']"

The exemption threshold is adjusted to increase to $2.112 billion from $2.069 billion. The adjustment is based on the 2.1 percent increase in the average of the CPI-W for the 12-month period ending in November 2017.

The adjustment to the escrows asset- size exemption threshold will also increase a similar threshold for small-creditor portfolio and balloon-payment qualified mortgages.

The amendments are designed to address money market funds' susceptibility to heavy redemptions in times of stress, improve their ability to manage and mitigate potential contagion from such redemptions, and increase the transparency of their risks, while preserving, as much as possible, their benefits. The SEC is removing the valuation exemption that permitted institutional non-government money market funds (whose investors historically have made the heaviest redemptions in times of stress) to maintain a stable net asset value per share (``NAV''), and is requiring those funds to sell and redeem shares based on the current market-based value of the securities in their underlying portfolios rounded to the fourth decimal place (e.g., $1.0000), i.e., transact at a ``floating'' NAV. The SEC also is adopting amendments that will give the boards of directors of money market funds new tools to stem heavy redemptions by giving them discretion to impose a liquidity fee if a fund's weekly liquidity level falls below the required regulatory threshold, and giving them discretion to suspend redemptions temporarily, i.e., to ``gate'' funds, under the same circumstances. These amendments will require all non-government money market funds to impose a liquidity fee if the fund's weekly liquidity level falls below a designated threshold, unless the fund's board determines that imposing such a fee is not in the best interests of the fund. In addition, the SEC is adopting amendments designed to make money market funds more resilient by increasing the diversification of their portfolios, enhancing their stress testing, and improving transparency by requiring money market funds to report additional information to the SEC and to investors.

The proposed approach, called the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk (SA-CCR), would replace the current exposure methodology (CEM) as an additional methodology for calculating advanced approaches total risk-weighted assets under the capital rule. An advanced approaches banking organization also would be required to use SA-CCR to calculate its standardized total risk-weighted assets; a non-advanced approaches banking organization could elect to use either CEM or SA-CCR for calculating its standardized total risk-weighted assets. In addition, the proposal would modify other aspects of the capital rule to account for the proposed implementation of SA-CCR. Specifically, the proposal would require an advanced approaches banking organization to use SA-CCR with some adjustments to determine the exposure amount of derivative contracts for calculating total leverage exposure (the denominator of the supplementary leverage ratio). The proposal also would incorporate SA-CCR into the cleared transactions framework and would make other amendments, generally with respect to cleared transactions. The proposed introduction of SA-CCR would indirectly affect the Board's single counterparty credit limit rule, along with other rules. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency also is proposing to update cross-references to CEM and add SA-CCR as an option for determining exposure amounts for derivative contracts in its lending limit rules.",2018-12-17,"['Administrative practice and procedure', 'Banks, banking', 'Banks, banking', 'Banks, banking', 'Banks, banking', 'Federal Reserve System', 'Holding companies', 'National banks', 'Reporting and recordkeeping requirements', 'Savings associations']"

First, the rule identifies it as an unfair and abusive practice for a lender to make covered short-term or longer- term balloon-payment loans, including payday and vehicle title loans, without reasonably determining that consumers have the ability to repay the loans according to their terms. The rule exempts certain loans from the underwriting criteria prescribed in the rule if they have specific consumer protections. Second, for the same set of loans along with certain other high-cost longer-term loans, the rule identifies it as an unfair and abusive practice to make attempts to withdraw payment from consumers' accounts after two consecutive payment attempts have failed, unless the consumer provides a new and specific authorization to do so. Finally, the rule prescribes notices to consumers before attempting to withdraw payments from their account, as well as processes and criteria for registration of information systems, for requirements to furnish and obtain information from them, and for compliance programs and record retention. The rule prohibits evasions and operates as a floor leaving State and local jurisdictions to adopt further regulatory measures (whether a usury limit or other protections) as appropriate to protect consumers.",2017-11-17,"['Banks, banking', 'Banks, banking', 'Banks, banking', 'Banks, banking', 'Consumer protection', 'Credit', 'Credit unions', 'National banks', 'Reporting and recordkeeping requirements', 'Savings associations', 'Trade practices']"

While the Board is not committing to any specific actions, potential actions include the Federal Reserve Banks developing a service for 24x7x365 real-time interbank settlement of faster payments; and a liquidity management tool that would enable transfers between Federal Reserve accounts on a 24x7x365 basis to support services for real-time interbank settlement of faster payments, whether those services are provided by the private sector or the Federal Reserve Banks.

New rule 498A under the Securities Act of 1933 will permit a person to satisfy its prospectus delivery obligations under the Securities Act for a variable annuity or variable life insurance contract by sending or giving a summary prospectus to investors and making the statutory prospectus available online. The rule also will consider a person to have met its prospectus delivery obligations for any portfolio companies associated with a variable annuity or variable life insurance contract if the portfolio company prospectuses are posted online. To implement the new disclosure framework, we are also amending the registration forms for variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts to update and enhance the disclosures to investors in these contracts, and to implement the proposed summary prospectus framework, and adopting amendments to our rules that will require variable contracts to use the Inline eXtensible Business Reporting Language (``Inline XBRL'') format for the submission of certain required disclosures in the variable contract statutory prospectus. The Commission is also taking the position that if an issuer of a discontinued contract that is discontinued as of July 1, 2020 that provides alternative disclosures does not file post-effective amendments to update a variable contract registration statement and does not provide updated prospectuses to existing investors, this would not provide a basis for enforcement action so long as investors are provided with the alternative disclosures or modernized alternative disclosures described below.

The proposed rules would not provide security holders with the right to nominate directors where it is prohibited by state law. Instead, the proposed rules are intended to create a mechanism for nominees of long-term security holders, or groups of long-term security holders, with significant holdings to be included in company proxy materials where there are indications that security holders need such access to further an effective proxy process. This mechanism would apply in those instances where evidence suggests that the company has been unresponsive to security holder concerns as they relate to the proxy process. The proposed rules would enable security holders to engage in limited solicitations to form nominating security holder groups and engage in solicitations in support of their nominees without disseminating a proxy statement. The proposed rules also would establish the filing requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for nominating security holders.",2003-10-23,"['Investment companies', 'Reporting and recordkeeping requirements', 'Securities']"

As a result, the overall framework for exempt offerings has changed significantly.

More specifically, we also believe that issuers and investors could benefit from a framework that is more consistent and addresses gaps and complexities. Therefore, we seek comment on possible ways to simplify, harmonize, and improve the exempt offering framework to promote capital formation and expand investment opportunities while maintaining appropriate investor protections.",2019-06-26,[]

The amendments require lenders to report data items related to loan pricing; for loan originations in which the annual percentage rate (APR) exceeds the yield for comparable Treasury securities by a specified amount or threshold, the lender will report the spread or difference between the APR and the Treasury yield. The Board has tentatively set the thresholds at 3 percentage points for first lien loans, and 5 percentage points for second lien loans, but is seeking comment on these thresholds in a separate proposed rule published in today's Federal Register. Lenders also must report whether a loan is covered by the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act (HOEPA). The final rule also requires lenders to report whether an application or loan involves a manufactured home. The Board is revising certain definitions in the regulation. The definition of an application is revised to include a request for preapproval as defined in the regulation, for purposes of reporting denials of such requests. To promote consistency in the reported data, the definition of a refinancing, and the definition of a home improvement loan are revised. In addition, the amendments conform the collection of data on race and ethnicity to standards established by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget in 1997.

The proposed rule would clarify that deposits in these foreign branches of United States banks are not FDIC-insured deposits. This would be the case whether or not they are dually payable both at the branch outside the United States and at an office within the United States. As discussed further below, a recent proposal by the United Kingdom's Financial Services Authority (``U.K. FSA'') makes it very likely that large United States banks will be changing their United Kingdom foreign branch deposit agreements to make them payable both in the United Kingdom and the United States. This action has the potential to increase significantly the exposure of the Deposit Insurance Fund (``DIF'') and operational complexities were such deposits to be treated as insured. The purpose of this proposed rule is to preserve confidence in the FDIC deposit insurance system, ensure that the FDIC can effectively carry out its critical deposit insurance functions, and protect the DIF against the uncertain liability that it would otherwise face as a global deposit insurer. Should a United States bank make its foreign deposits dually payable, those deposits would be considered ``deposit liabilities'' under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act's (``FDI Act'') depositor preference regime, and would therefore be on an equal footing with domestic deposits in the event of the bank's liquidation.",2013-02-19,"['Bank deposit insurance', 'Banks, banking', 'Banks, banking', 'Banks, banking', 'Banks, banking', 'Reporting and recordkeeping requirements', 'Savings associations', 'Trusts and trustees']"

Through amendments to the assessment regulations and corresponding changes to the Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (Call Report), CBLR banks would have the option of using either CBLR tangible equity or tier 1 capital for their assessment base calculation, and using either the CBLR or the tier 1 leverage ratio for the Leverage Ratio that the FDIC uses to calculate an established small bank's assessment rate. Through this NPR, the FDIC also would clarify that a CBLR bank that meets the definition of a custodial bank would have no change to its custodial bank deduction or reporting items required to calculate the deduction; and the assessment regulations would continue to reference the prompt corrective action (PCA) regulations for the definitions of capital categories used in the deposit insurance assessment system, with technical amendments to align with the CBLR NPR.

Among other things, the CSE would comply with stringent rules regarding its group-wide internal risk management control system and would make periodic reports to the Commission, which would include group-wide financial and risk management information and a capital computation consistent with the Basel Standards.

U.S. Bank assumed this responsibility from Mellon Bank effective February 4, 2008.

The proposal would modify Regulation E to establish disclosure requirements specific to prepaid accounts that would require financial institutions to provide certain disclosures to consumers prior to and after the acquisition of a prepaid account. The proposal would also include an option for an alternative to Regulation E's periodic statement requirement that would permit prepaid product providers to make available to consumers certain methods for access to account information in lieu of sending periodic statements. Additionally, the proposal would apply Regulation E's limited liability and error resolution provisions to prepaid accounts, with certain modifications, including applying these provisions after account registration. Moreover, the proposal would require prepaid account issuers to provide the Bureau with terms and conditions for prepaid accounts, which it would post on a Web site maintained by the Bureau. Relatedly, issuers would also be required to post the terms and conditions on their own Web sites or make them available upon request. Finally, the proposal would also contain amendments to Regulations Z and E to regulate prepaid accounts with overdraft services or credit features. Among other things, prepaid cards that access overdraft services or credit features for a fee would generally be credit cards subject to Regulation Z and its credit card rules. Moreover, the proposal would require that consumers consent to overdraft services or credit features and give them at least 21 days to repay the debt incurred in connection with using such services or features. Further, Regulation E would be amended to include disclosures about overdraft services or credit features that could be linked to prepaid accounts.

The Rule establishes the requirements for submission and content of a Resolution Plan, as well as procedures for review by the FDIC. The Rule requires a covered insured depository institution (``CIDI'') to submit a Resolution Plan that should enable the FDIC, as receiver, to resolve the institution under Sections 11 and 13 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (``FDI Act''), 12 U.S.C. 1821 and 1823, in a manner that ensures that depositors receive access to their insured deposits within one business day of the institution's failure (two business days if the failure occurs on a day other than Friday), maximizes the net present value return from the sale or disposition of its assets and minimizes the amount of any loss to be realized by the institution's creditors. The FDIC finds that there is good cause and it is in the public interest to adopt the Rule. Resolution plans for large and complex insured depository institutions are essential for their orderly and least-cost resolution. The Rule is intended to address the continuing exposure of the banking industry to the risks of insolvency of large and complex insured depository institutions, an exposure that can be mitigated with proper resolution planning. The Rule enables the FDIC to perform its resolution functions most efficiently through extensive planning in cooperation with the CIDI and to enhance its ability to evaluate potential loss severity if an institution fails.",2011-09-21,"['Bank deposit insurance', 'Banks, banking', 'Banks, banking', 'Banks, banking', 'Banks, banking', 'Holding companies', 'National banks', 'Reporting and recordkeeping requirements', 'Savings associations']"

First, the FDIC proposes to rescind and remove from the Code of Federal Regulations 12 CFR part 391, subpart C (part 391, subpart C), entitled ``Fair Credit Reporting.'' This subpart was included in the regulations that were transferred to the FDIC from the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) in connection with the implementation of applicable provisions of title III of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act). The requirements for State savings associations in part 391, subpart C are substantively similar to those in the FDIC's 12 CFR part 334 (part 334), also entitled ``Fair Credit Reporting,'' and is applicable for all insured depository institutions (``IDIs'') for which the FDIC has been designated the appropriate Federal banking agency. The FDIC proposes to modify the scope of 12 CFRs 334.1(b), 334.90(a), and 334.91(a) to include State savings associations and their subsidiaries to conform to the scope of the FDIC's current supervisory responsibilities as the appropriate Federal banking agency. The FDIC also proposes to add new subsections to define ``State savings association'' as having the same meaning as in section 3(b)(3) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act). Second, the FDIC proposes to amend the definitional portion of its Identity Theft Red Flags regulations to be in conformance with the Red Flag Program Clarification Act of 2010. Third, the FDIC proposes to rescind and remove from the Code of Federal Regulations those portions of the FDIC's ``Fair Credit Reporting'' regulations where the rule writing authority was provided to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (``CFPB'') in the Dodd- Frank Act. The FDIC will continue to examine for and enforce violations of these regulations for all IDIs for which the FDIC has been designated the appropriate Federal banking agency. Consistent with this part of the proposal, the FDIC also proposes to make a technical change in one provision in its version of the Interagency Guidelines on Identity Theft Detection, Prevention, and Mitigation.",2015-01-30,[]

In this present proposed rule, the Bureau proposes the amendments to the General QM loan definition that are referenced in that separate proposal.

The Regulation D amendments also increase the amount of total reservable liabilities of each depository institution that is subject to a zero percent reserve requirement in 2005 from $6.6 million to $7.0 million. This amount is known as the reserve requirement exemption amount. The adjustments to both of these amounts are derived using statutory formulas specified in the Federal Reserve Act. The Board is also announcing increases in two other amounts, the nonexempt deposit cutoff level and the reduced reporting limit, that are used to determine the frequency with which depository institutions must submit deposit reports. The nonexempt deposit cutoff level is being increased from $161.2 million in 2004 to $169.8 million in 2005, and the reduced reporting limit is being increased from $1.074 billion in 2004 to $1.131 billion in 2005. These amounts are indexed annually in order to reduce reporting burden for smaller depository institutions. Thus, beginning in September 2005, depository institutions will be required to file the FR 2900 report each week under the following conditions: If they have net transaction accounts over $7.0 million and have total deposits of at least $169.8 million; or if they have net transaction accounts of $7.0 million or less but have total deposits of at least $1.131 billion. Depository institutions will be required to file the FR 2900 report each quarter if they have net transaction accounts over $7.0 million but have total deposits of less than $169.8 million. Depository institutions will be required to file the FR 2910a report annually if they have net transaction accounts of $7.0 million or less but have total deposits greater than $7.0 million but less than $1.131 billion.

This NPR (Standardized Approach NPR) includes proposed changes to the agencies' general risk-based capital requirements for determining risk-weighted assets (that is, the calculation of the denominator of a banking organization's risk-based capital ratios). The proposed changes would revise and harmonize the agencies' rules for calculating risk- weighted assets to enhance risk-sensitivity and address weaknesses identified over recent years, including by incorporating certain international capital standards of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) set forth in the standardized approach of the ``International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards: A Revised Framework'' (Basel II), as revised by the BCBS between 2006 and 2009, and other proposals addressed in recent consultative papers of the BCBS. In this NPR, the agencies also propose alternatives to credit ratings for calculating risk-weighted assets for certain assets, consistent with section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act). The revisions include methodologies for determining risk-weighted assets for residential mortgages, securitization exposures, and counterparty credit risk. The changes in the Standardized Approach NPR are proposed to take effect on January 1, 2015, with an option for early adoption. The Standardized Approach NPR also would introduce disclosure requirements that would apply to top-tier banking organizations domiciled in the United States with $50 billion or more in total assets, including disclosures related to regulatory capital instruments.

The proposals would encompass disclosure in two areas: accounting estimates a company makes in applying its accounting policies and the initial adoption by a company of an accounting policy that has a material impact on its financial presentation. Under the first part of the proposals, a company would have to identify the accounting estimates reflected in its financial statements that required it to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time of estimation. Disclosure about those estimates would then be required if different estimates that the company reasonably could have used in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, would have a material impact on the presentation of the company's financial condition, changes in financial condition or results of operations. A company's disclosure about these critical accounting estimates would include a discussion of: the methodology and assumptions underlying them; the effect the accounting estimates have on the company's financial presentation; and the effect of changes in the estimates. Under the second part of the proposals, a company that has initially adopted an accounting policy with a material impact would have to disclose information that includes: what gave rise to the initial adoption; the impact of the adoption; the accounting principle adopted and method of applying it; and the choices it had among accounting principles. Companies would place all of the new disclosure in the ``Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' section (commonly referred to as ``MD&A'') of their annual reports, registration statements and proxy and information statements.

The OCC, the Board, the Bureau, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), and the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) (collectively, the Agencies) issued joint final rules implementing these requirements, effective January 18, 2014.

If there is no annual percentage increase in the CPI-W, the OCC, the Board, and the Bureau will not adjust this exemption threshold from the prior year. However, in years following a year in which the exemption threshold was not adjusted, the threshold is calculated by applying the annual percentage increase in the CPI-W to the dollar amount that would have resulted, after rounding, if the decreases and any subsequent increases in the CPI-W had been taken into account.

Rule 13h-1 will require a ``large trader,'' defined as a person whose transactions in NMS securities equal or exceed 2 million shares or $20 million during any calendar day, or 20 million shares or $200 million during any calendar month, to identify itself to the Commission and make certain disclosures to the Commission on Form 13H. Upon receipt of Form 13H, the Commission will assign to each large trader an identification number that will uniquely and uniformly identify the trader, which the large trader must then provide to its registered broker-dealers. Such registered broker-dealers will then be required to maintain records of two additional data elements in connection with transactions effected through accounts of such large traders (the large trader identification number, and the time transactions in the account are executed). In addition, the Commission is requiring that such broker-dealers report large trader transaction information to the Commission upon request through the Electronic Blue Sheets systems currently used by broker-dealers for reporting trade information. Finally, certain registered broker-dealers subject to the Rule will be required to perform limited monitoring of their customers' accounts for activity that may trigger the large trader identification requirements of Rule 13h-1.

The interim capital treatment allows sponsoring banking organizations to remove the consolidated ABCP program assets from their risk-weighted asset bases for the purpose of calculating their risk-based capital ratios. Sponsoring banking organizations must continue to hold risk-based capital against all other risk exposures arising in connection with ABCP programs, including direct credit substitutes, recourse obligations, residual interests, long-term liquidity facilities, and loans, in accordance with each agency's existing risk-based capital standards. In addition, any minority interests in ABCP programs that are consolidated as a result of FIN 46 are to be excluded from sponsoring banking organizations' minority interest component of tier 1 capital and, hence, from total risk-based capital. This interim capital treatment will be applicaable only for the regulatory reporting periods ending September 30 and December 31, 2003, and March 31, 2004. In addition, this interim capital treatment does not alter the accounting rules for balance sheet consolidation nor does it affect the denominator of the tier 1 leverage capital ratio calculation, which continues to be based primarily on on-balance sheet assets as reported under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Thus, as a result of FIN 46, banking organizations must include all assets of consolidated ABCP programs in on-balance sheet assets for purposes of calculating the tier 1 leverage capital ratio.

The removal of the sunset provision is contingent upon the agencies implementing alternative, more risk-sensitive risk-based capital requirements for credit exposures arising from involvement with ABCP programs. See Section I of the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION for discussion of a related joint interim final rule published concurrently with this notice of proposed rulemaking. The agencies also are proposing to require banking organizations to hold risk-based capital against liquidity facilities with an original maturity of one year or less that organizations provide to ABCP programs, regardless of whether the organization sponsors the program or must consolidate the program under GAAP. This treatment recognizes that such facilities expose banking organizations to credit risk and is consistent with the industry's practice of internally allocating economic capital against this risk associated with such facilities. A separate capital charge on liquidity facilities provided to an ABCP program would not be required if a banking organization must or chooses to consolidate the program for purposes of risk-based capital. In addition, the agencies are proposing a risk-based capital charge for certain types of securitizations of revolving retail credit facilities (for example, credit card receivables) that incorporate early amortization provisions. The effect of these capital proposals will be to more closely align the risk-based capital requirements with the associated risk of the exposures.

HOEPA imposes additional disclosure requirements and substantive limitations (for example, restricting short-term balloon notes) on home-equity loans bearing rates or fees above a certain percentage or amount. The Board's amendments to Regulation Z broaden the scope of mortgage loans subject to HOEPA by adjusting the price triggers used to determine coverage under the act. The rate-based trigger is lowered by two percentage points for first-lien mortgage loans, with no change for subordinate-lien loans. The fee-based trigger is revised to include the cost of optional credit insurance and similar debt protection products paid at closing. The amendments restrict certain acts and practices in connection with home-secured loans. For example, creditors may not engage in repeated refinancings of their HOEPA loans over a short time period when the transactions are not in the borrower's interest.

This would be the case even if they are also payable at an office within the United States (``dual payability'').

This action has the potential to expose the Deposit Insurance Fund (``DIF'') to expanded deposit insurance liability and create operational complexities if these types of deposits were treated as insured.

These proposed rules would implement new statutory provisions enacted by the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 (``CFMA''). Specifically, the CFMA directs the Commissions to jointly specify by rule or regulation the method to be used to determine ``dollar value of average daily trading volume'' and ``market capitalization'' for purposes of the new definition of ``narrow-based security index'' in the CEA and the Exchange Act. Proposed Rule 41.11 under the CEA and proposed Rule 3a55-1 under the Exchange Act are intended to fulfill this statutory directive by specifying such methods. In addition, these proposed rules define certain terms that would add clarity to the statutory definition of ``narrow-based security index.'' In addition, proposed Rule 41.12 under the CEA and proposed Rule 3a55-2 under the Exchange Act would create an exception to the definition of narrow-based security index, to permit, subject to certain conditions, a designated contract market, registered derivatives transaction execution facility (``DTEF''), or foreign board of trade to continue trading a contract of sale for future delivery on a security index that becomes a narrow-based security index during the first 30 days after the future begins trading. Similarly, proposed Rule 41.14 under the CEA would permit a national securities exchange to continue trading a contract of sale for future delivery on an index that ceases to be a narrow-based security index, subject to certain conditions. These rules are intended to minimize market disruption when a broad-based security index becomes a narrow-based security index, and when a narrow-based security index becomes a broad-based security index. Finally, proposed Rule 41.13 under the CEA and proposed Rule 3a55-3 under the Exchange Act would provide that when a futures contract on a security index is traded on or subject to the rules of a foreign board of trade, that index shall not be considered a narrow-based security index if it would not be a narrow-based security index pursuant to the statutory definition of a narrow-based security index or the exclusions from that definition. These rules would clarify and establish that when a futures contract on a security index is traded on or subject to the rules of a foreign board of trade, the index underlying such contract shall be considered a broad-based security index if it qualifies as such pursuant to the statutory definition of narrow-based security index, or pursuant to the exclusions from that definition.",2001-05-17,"['Reporting and recordkeeping requirements', 'Securities']"

03-98.xml,"Removal, Suspension, and Debarment of Accountants From Performing Audit Services","The OCC, Board, FDIC, and OTS (each an Agency, and collectively, the Agencies) propose to revise their respective rules of practice pursuant to section 36 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA) (12 U.S.C. 1831m). Section 36, as implemented by 12 CFR part 363, requires that each insured depository institution with total assets of $500 million or more produce an annual report containing the institution's financial statements and certain management assessments. The depository institution must provide the report to the FDIC, the appropriate Federal banking agency, and any appropriate state bank supervisor. Section 36 also requires that the depository institution obtain an audit of its financial statements and an attestation on management's assertions concerning internal controls over financial reporting by an independent public accountant (accountant) and include the accountant's audit and attestation reports in its annual report. Congress gave the Agencies authority to remove, suspend, or debar accountants from performing the audit services required by section 36 if there is good cause to do so. This proposal would amend the Agencies' rules to establish rules of practice and procedure for the removal, suspension, and debarment of accountants and their firms from performing section 36 audit services for insured depository institutions. The proposal reflects the Agencies' increasing concern with the quality of audits and internal controls for financial reporting at insured depository institutions. Although there have been few bank and thrift failures in recent years, the circumstances of the failures that have occurred illustrate the importance of maintaining high quality in the audits of the financial position and attestations of management assessments of insured depository institutions.

E8-3424.xml,Exemption From Registration Under Section 12(G) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for Foreign Private Issuers,"We are proposing amendments to the rule that exempts a foreign private issuer from having to register a class of equity securities under Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act'') based on the submission to the Commission of certain information published outside the United States. The exemption allows a foreign private issuer to exceed the registration thresholds of Section 12(g) and effectively have its equity securities traded on a limited basis in the over-the-counter market in the United States. Currently, in order to obtain the exemption under Exchange Act Rule 12g3-2(b), a non- reporting foreign private issuer must submit to the Commission written materials in paper, including a list of information that the issuer must disclose publicly pursuant to its home jurisdiction laws or stock exchange requirements, or that is sent to its security holders, along with paper copies of documents containing the required information that the issuer has published for its last fiscal year. A successful applicant may maintain the exemption by submitting to the Commission paper copies of these documents on an ongoing basis. The proposed amendments would eliminate paper submission requirements by automatically granting the Rule 12g3-2(b) exemption to a foreign private issuer that meets specified conditions, which do not depend on a count of an issuer's United States security holders, and which would require an issuer to publish electronically in English specified non- United States disclosure documents. As a result, the proposed amendments should make it easier for U.S. investors to gain access to a foreign private issuer's material non-United States disclosure documents and make better informed decisions regarding whether to invest in that issuer's equity securities through the over-the-counter market in the United States or otherwise.",2008-02-25,"['Reporting and recordkeeping requirements', 'Securities']"

The requirement is designed to promote the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile of large and internationally active banking organizations, thereby improving the banking sector's ability to absorb shocks arising from financial and economic stress, and to further improve the measurement and management of liquidity risk. The final rule establishes a quantitative minimum liquidity coverage ratio that requires a company subject to the rule to maintain an amount of high-quality liquid assets (the numerator of the ratio) that is no less than 100 percent of its total net cash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day period (the denominator of the ratio). The final rule applies to large and internationally active banking organizations, generally, bank holding companies, certain savings and loan holding companies, and depository institutions with $250 billion or more in total assets or $10 billion or more in on- balance sheet foreign exposure and to their consolidated subsidiaries that are depository institutions with $10 billion or more in total consolidated assets. The final rule focuses on these financial institutions because of their complexity, funding profiles, and potential risk to the financial system. Therefore, the agencies do not intend to apply the final rule to community banks. In addition, the Board is separately adopting a modified minimum liquidity coverage ratio requirement for bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies without significant insurance or commercial operations that, in each case, have $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets but that are not internationally active.

The Regulation D amendments increase the amount of net transaction accounts at each depository institution that are subject to a three percent reserve requirement in 2004 from $42.1 million to $45.4 million. This amount is known as the low reserve tranche. The Regulation D amendments also increase the amount of total reservable liabilities of each depository institution that are subject to a zero percent reserve requirement in 2004 from $6.0 million to $6.6 million. This amount is known as the reserve requirement exemption amount. The adjustments to both of these amounts are derived using statutory formulas specified in the Federal Reserve Act. The Board is also announcing increases in two other amounts, the deposit cutoff level and the reduced reporting limit, that are used to determine the frequency with which depository institutions must submit deposit reports. The deposit cutoff level is being increased from $150.0 million in 2003 to $161.2 million in 2004, and the reduced reporting limit is being increased from $1.0 billion in 2003 to $1.074 billion in 2004.

Accordingly, the Board is proposing to make corresponding amendments to Regulation M, which implements the CLA, and to the accompanying staff commentary.

First, the Board is adopting an interpretation confirming that section 23A does not apply to extensions of credit by an insured depository institution to customers that use the loan proceeds to purchase a security or other asset through an affiliate of the depository institution, so long as the affiliate is acting exclusively as a broker in the transaction, and the affiliate retains no portion of the loan proceeds. The Board also is exempting from section 23A that portion of a loan to a third party that an affiliate retains as a market-rate brokerage commission or agency fee. In addition, the Board is adopting an exemption from section 23A for extensions of credit by an insured depository institution to customers that use the loan proceeds to purchase a security issued by third parties through a broker-dealer affiliate of the institution that is acting as riskless principal in the securities transaction. Finally, the Board is adopting an exemption for extensions of credit by an insured depository institution to customers that use the credit to purchase securities from a broker-dealer affiliate of the institution when that extension of credit was made pursuant to a preexisting line of credit not entered into in contemplation of the purchase of securities from an affiliate of the depository institution.",2001-05-11,"['Banks, banking', 'Banks, banking', 'Banks, banking', 'Banks, banking', 'Federal Reserve System']"

2010-4409.xml,Amendments to Regulation SHO,"The Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') is adopting amendments to Regulation SHO under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act''). We are adopting a short sale-related circuit breaker that, if triggered, will impose a restriction on the prices at which securities may be sold short (``short sale price test'' or ``short sale price test restriction''). Specifically, the Rule requires that a trading center establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent the execution or display of a short sale order of a covered security at a price that is less than or equal to the current national best bid if the price of that covered security decreases by 10% or more from the covered security's closing price as determined by the listing market for the covered security as of the end of regular trading hours on the prior day. In addition, the Rule requires that the trading center establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to impose this short sale price test restriction for the remainder of the day and the following day when a national best bid for the covered security is calculated and disseminated on a current and continuing basis by a plan processor pursuant to an effective national market system plan. We believe it is appropriate at this time to adopt a short sale-related circuit breaker because, when triggered, it will prevent short selling, including potentially manipulative or abusive short selling, from driving down further the price of a security that has already experienced a significant intra-day price decline, and will facilitate the ability of long sellers to sell first upon such a decline. This approach establishes a narrowly-tailored Rule that will target only those securities that are experiencing significant intra- day price declines. We believe that addressing short selling in connection with such declines in individual securities will help address erosion of investor confidence in our markets generally. In addition, we are amending Regulation SHO to provide that a broker-dealer may mark certain qualifying sell orders ``short exempt.'' In particular, if the broker-dealer chooses to rely on its own determination that it is submitting the short sale order to the trading center at a price that is above the current national best bid at the time of submission or to rely on an exception specified in the Rule, it must mark the order as ``short exempt.'' This ``short exempt'' marking requirement will aid surveillance by self-regulatory organizations (``SROs'') and the Commission for compliance with the provisions of Rule 201 of Regulation SHO.",2010-03-10,"['Brokers', 'Fraud', 'Reporting and recordkeeping requirements', 'Securities']"

Section 129H of TILA establishes special appraisal requirements for ``higher-risk mortgages,'' termed ``higher-priced mortgage loans'' or ``HPMLs'' in the agencies' regulations. The OCC, the Board, the Bureau, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), and the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) (collectively, the Agencies) issued joint final rules implementing these requirements, effective January 18, 2014.

If there is no annual percentage increase in the CPI-W, the OCC, the Board, and the Bureau will not adjust this exemption threshold from the prior year. However, in years following a year in which the exemption threshold was not adjusted, the threshold is calculated by applying the annual percentage increase in the CPI-W to the dollar amount that would have resulted, after rounding, if the decreases and any subsequent increases in the CPI-W had been taken into account.

The proposed amendments would implement a provision of the National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996 by permitting the use of a prospectus under section 10(b) of the Securities Act with respect to securities issued by an investment company that includes information the substance of which is not included in the investment company's statutory prospectus.

Under the proposed rule, any U.S. top-tier bank holding company identified by the Board as a global systemically important banking organization (GSIB), the subsidiaries of any U.S. GSIB (other than national banks and federal savings associations), and the U.S. operations of any foreign GSIB (other than national banks and federal savings associations) would be subjected to restrictions regarding the terms of their non-cleared qualified financial contracts (QFCs). First, a covered entity would generally be required to ensure that QFCs to which it is party, including QFCs entered into outside the United States, provide that any default rights and restrictions on the transfer of the QFCs are limited to the same extent as they would be under the Dodd-Frank Act and the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. Second, a covered entity would generally be prohibited from being party to QFCs that would allow a QFC counterparty to exercise default rights against the covered entity based on the entry into a resolution proceeding under the Dodd-Frank Act, Federal Deposit Insurance Act, or any other resolution proceeding of an affiliate of the covered entity. The proposal would also amend certain definitions in the Board's capital and liquidity rules; these amendments are intended to ensure that the regulatory capital and liquidity treatment of QFCs to which a covered entity is party is not affected by the proposed restrictions on such QFCs. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is expected to issue a proposed rule that would subject national banks and federal savings associations that are GSIB subsidiaries to requirements substantively identical to those proposed here.",2016-05-11,"['Administrative practice and procedure', 'Banks, banking', 'Banks, banking', 'Banks, banking', 'Banks, banking', 'Federal Reserve System', 'Holding companies', 'Reporting and recordkeeping requirements', 'Securities']"

The Commission is adopting these amendments in light of the rules recently adopted by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (``Board''), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (``FDIC''), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (``OCC'') (collectively, the ``QFC Rules'') that impose restrictions on certain uncleared swaps and uncleared security-based swaps and other financial contracts.

Under the extension, a non-accelerated filer is not required to provide management's report on internal control over financial reporting until it files an annual report for its first fiscal year ending on or after December 15, 2007. If we have not issued additional guidance for management on how to complete its assessment of internal control over financial reporting in time to be of sufficient assistance in connection with annual reports filed for fiscal years ending on or after December 15, 2007, we will consider whether we should further postpone this date. A non-accelerated filer is not required to file the auditor's attestation report on internal control over financial reporting until it files an annual report for its first fiscal year ending on or after December 15, 2008.

The proposed rules, which also include non- substantive amendments and various conforming changes to other Commission regulations, reflect the Commission's enhanced knowledge and experience with swaps trading characteristics and would further the Dodd-Frank Act's statutory goals for SEFs, i.e., promote more SEF trading and pre-trade price transparency in the swaps market.

One category of QMs is the General QM category. For General QMs, the ratio of the consumer's total monthly debt to total monthly income (DTI or DTI ratio) must not exceed 43 percent. This final rule amends the General QM loan definition in Regulation Z. Among other things, the final rule removes the General QM loan definition's 43 percent DTI limit and replaces it with price-based thresholds.

The Commission is also soliciting comments regarding alternative measures that could be taken to differentiate NRSROs' structured finance credit ratings from the credit ratings they issue for other types of financial instruments through, for example, enhanced disclosures of information. The Commission also is soliciting comment on whether the rule amendments being adopted today in a separate release designed to remove impediments to determining and monitoring non-issuer-paid credit ratings for structured finance products should be extended to create a mechanism for determining non- issuer-paid credit ratings for structured finance products that were issued prior to the rule becoming effective (e.g., to allow for non- issuer-paid credit ratings for structured finance products of the 2004- 2007 vintage).

The leverage buffer functions like the capital conservation buffer for the risk-based capital ratios in the 2013 revised capital rule. A covered BHC that maintains a leverage buffer of tier 1 capital in an amount greater than 2 percent of its total leverage exposure is not subject to limitations on distributions and discretionary bonus payments under the final rule.

Independent credit card banks would pay an additional assessment component based on the ``receivables attributable'' to credit card accounts owned by the bank. This additional assessment is intended to result in payment by these banks of a more appropriate share of the OCC's expenses than under the current book-asset assessment structure. The OCC also proposes to raise the surcharge for all institutions with composite ratings of 3, 4, or 5 under the Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System (UFIRS) (also referred to as the CAMELS rating) and for Federal branches and agencies of foreign banks that receive a composite rating of 3, 4, or 5 under the ROCA rating system. This amendment will enable the OCC to allocate more equitably the expenses we incur in supervising institutions that are experiencing significant problems, which necessitate more extensive utilization of OCC resources.

The surcharge will equal an annual rate of 4.5 basis points applied to the institution's assessment base (with certain adjustments). If the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF or fund) reserve ratio reaches 1.15 percent before July 1, 2016, surcharges will begin July 1, 2016.

Surcharges will continue through the quarter that the reserve ratio first reaches or exceeds 1.35 percent, but not later than December 31, 2018. The FDIC expects that surcharges will commence in the second half of 2016 and that they should be sufficient to raise the DIF reserve ratio to 1.35 percent in approximately eight quarters, i.e., before the end of 2018.

2013-30024.xml,Availability of Funds and Collection of Checks,"On March 25, 2011, the Board published a notice of proposed rulemaking (``2011 proposal'') intended to facilitate the banking industry's ongoing transition to fully electronic interbank check collection and return. Based on its analysis of the comments received in response to the 2011 proposal, the Board is revising its proposed amendments to subparts C and D of Regulation CC and is requesting comment on a revised proposed rule that would, among other things, encourage depositary banks to receive and paying banks to send returned checks electronically. The Board is requesting comment on two alternative frameworks for return requirements. Under Alternative 1, the expeditious-return requirement currently imposed on paying banks and returning banks for returned checks would be eliminated; a paying bank returning a check would be required to provide the depositary bank with a notice of nonpayment of the check--regardless of the amount of the check being returned--only if the paying bank sends the returned check in paper form. Under Alternative 2, the current expeditious- return requirement--using the current two-day test--would be retained for checks being returned to a depositary bank electronically via another bank, but the notice-of-nonpayment requirement would be eliminated. The Board is proposing to retain, without change, the regulation's current same-day settlement rule for paper checks. In addition, the Board is also requesting comment on applying Regulation CC's existing check warranties to checks that are collected electronically and on new warranties and indemnities related to checks collected electronically and to electronically-created items.",2014-02-04,"['Banks, banking', 'Banks, banking', 'Banks, banking', 'Banks, banking', 'Federal Reserve System', 'Reporting and recordkeeping requirements']"

Commodity pool annual reports filed with a registered futures association (currently, the NFA is the sole registered futures association) must contain a manually signed oath or affirmation under Commission regulations and no provision exists for electronic filing of annual reports with NFA. The NFA has recently petitioned the Commission to amend its regulations to require mandatory electronic filing of commodity pool annual reports. The Commission has considered the NFA petition and is hereby proposing to amend Commission regulations: (i) To require CPOs to file a commodity pool annual report with NFA electronically, with the required oath or affirmation to be made through compliance with NFA's electronic filing procedures; (ii) to require CPOs to maintain for five years a manually signed copy of each annual report and to maintain records of how certain key financial balances submitted to NFA were compiled from the annual report; (iii) to eliminate the requirement that the annual report filed with NFA be manually signed. Further, the Commission is proposing additional amendments to clarify certain aspects of the Commission's regulations applicable to CPOs with respect to financial reporting, Specifically, the Commission is proposing amendments that would: explicitly state that commodity pool monthly and/or quarterly account statements distributed to participants must be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; clarify that COPs must file a notification of a change in a public accountant for a commodity pool with the Commission and with NFA; clarify that a reference to ``segregation'' with respect to a statement required to be made in an accountant's letter refers to the prohibition on commingling of funds of a commodity pool with the assets of any other person; and require that notifications concerning CPOs' election of fiscal years for commodity pools other than the calendar year or changes in fiscal year be filed solely with NFA and not the Commission.

E9-11567.xml,Truth in Lending,"On July 30, 2008, the Board published a final rule amending Regulation Z, which implements the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) and the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act (HOEPA). The July 2008 final rule requires creditors to give consumers transaction-specific cost disclosures shortly after application for closed-end loans secured by a consumer's principal dwelling. The disclosures must be provided before the consumer pays any fee, other than a fee for obtaining the consumer's credit history. Also on July 30, 2008, the Congress enacted the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, which included amendments to TILA, known as the Mortgage Disclosure Improvement Act of 2008 (MDIA). On October 3, 2008, the Congress amended the MDIA in connection with its enactment of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (Stabilization Act). The Board is now revising Regulation Z to implement the provisions of the MDIA, as amended. The MDIA broadens and adds to the requirements of the Board's July 2008 final rule. Among other things, the MDIA requires early, transaction-specific disclosures for mortgage loans secured by dwellings other than the consumer's principal dwelling and requires waiting periods between the time when disclosures are given and consummation of the mortgage transaction. Moreover, these requirements of the MDIA will become effective on July 30, 2009, about two months earlier than the Board's regulatory amendments adopted in the July 2008 final rule. Consistent with the MDIA, the final rule amending Regulation Z requires creditors to make good faith estimates of the required mortgage disclosures, and deliver or place them in the mail, no later than three business days after receiving a consumer's application for a dwelling-secured closed-end loan. Consummation may occur on or after the seventh business day after the delivery or mailing of these disclosures. If the annual percentage rate provided in the good faith estimates changes beyond a specified tolerance for accuracy, creditors must provide corrected disclosures, which the consumer must receive on or before the third business day before consummation of the transaction. The final rule allows consumers to expedite consummation to meet a bona fide personal financial emergency. The MDIA, as amended by the Stabilization Act, specifies different requirements for providing early disclosures for mortgage transactions that are secured by a consumer's interest in a timeshare plan.",2009-05-19,"['Advertising', 'Consumer protection', 'Federal Reserve System', 'Mortgages', 'Reporting and recordkeeping requirements', 'Truth in lending']"

The final rule establishes a quantitative metric, the NSFR, to measure the stability of the funding profile of certain large banking organizations and requires these banking organizations to maintain minimum amounts of stable funding to support their assets, commitments, and derivatives exposures over a one-year time horizon. The NSFR is designed to reduce the likelihood that disruptions to a banking organization's regular sources of funding will compromise its liquidity position, promote effective liquidity risk management, and support the ability of banking organizations to provide financial intermediation to businesses and households across a range of market conditions. The NSFR supports financial stability by requiring banking organizations to fund their activities with stable sources of funding on an ongoing basis, reducing the possibility that funding shocks would substantially increase distress at individual banking organizations. The final rule applies to certain large U.S. depository institution holding companies, depository institutions, and U.S. intermediate holding companies of foreign banking organizations, each with total consolidated assets of $100 billion or more, together with certain depository institution subsidiaries (together, covered companies). Under the final rule, the NSFR requirement increases in stringency based on risk-based measures of the top-tier covered company. U.S. depository institution holding companies and U.S. intermediate holding companies subject to the final rule are required to publicly disclose their NSFR and certain components of their NSFR every second and fourth calendar quarter for each of the two immediately preceding calendar quarters.

Under the current rules, a foreign private issuer may find it difficult to terminate its Exchange Act registration and reporting obligations despite the fact that there is relatively little interest in the issuer's U.S.- registered securities among United States investors. Moreover, currently a foreign private issuer can only suspend, and cannot terminate, a duty to report arising under section 15(d) of the Exchange Act. Reproposed Exchange Act Rule 12h-6 would permit the termination of Exchange Act reporting regarding a class of equity securities under either section 12(g) or section 15(d) of the Exchange Act by a foreign private issuer that meets a quantitative benchmark designed to measure relative U.S. market interest for that class of securities, which does not depend on a head count of the issuer's U.S. security holders. The reproposed benchmark would require the comparison of the average daily trading volume of an issuer's securities in the United States with that in its primary trading market. Because the Commission did not fully address this approach when it originally proposed Rule 12h-6, and because of other proposed changes to Rule 12h-6 not fully discussed in the original rule proposal, we are reproposing Rule 12h-6 and the accompanying rule amendments.

The proposed amendments to the rule would eliminate the restriction on offers and ease the issuer eligibility requirements, while limiting the availability of the exemption at the federal level to issuers that comply with certain requirements of state securities laws. We further propose rule amendments to Rule 504 of Regulation D under the Securities Act to facilitate issuers' capital raising efforts and provide additional investor protections. The proposed amendments to Rule 504 would increase the aggregate amount of securities that may be offered and sold in any twelve-month period from $1 million to $5 million and disqualify certain bad actors from participation in Rule 504 offerings.",2015-11-10,"['Reporting and recordkeeping requirements', 'Securities']"

To improve oversight of and investor confidence in the quality of financial reports filed with the Commission, the Commission will not recognize a PAB unless the PAB meets certain conditions and performs certain functions. A PAB must have a Board that is dominated by persons who are not members of the accounting profession and must be subject to the Commission's oversight.

A PAB also would set, or rely on and oversee designated private sector bodies to set, audit, quality control, and ethics standards.

The interim final rule incorporates these new requirements into the FDIC's prompt corrective action (PCA) framework. In addition, the interim final rule establishes limits on FDIC-supervised institutions' capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the FDIC-supervised institution does not hold a specified amount of common equity tier 1 capital in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements.

Second, the agencies are required to remove any references to, or requirements of reliance on, credit ratings and substitute such standard of creditworthiness as each agency determines is appropriate. The statute further provides that the agencies shall seek to establish, to the extent feasible, uniform standards of creditworthiness, taking into account the entities the agencies regulate and the purposes for which those entities would rely on such standards. On November 29, 2011, the OCC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), seeking comment on a proposal to revise its regulations pertaining to investment securities, securities offerings, and foreign bank capital equivalency deposits to replace references to credit ratings with alternative standards of creditworthiness.

Under the PSR policy, an FBO's strength of support assessment (``SOSA'') ranking can affect its eligibility for a positive net debit cap, the size of its net debit cap, and its eligibility to request a streamlined procedure to obtain maximum daylight overdraft capacity. Additionally, an FBO that is a financial holding company (``FHC'') can generally receive a higher net debit cap than an FBO that is not an FHC, and is generally eligible to request a streamlined procedure to obtain maximum daylight overdraft capacity.

This effort will be undertaken in connection with the Board's periodic review of its regulations; an advance notice of proposed rulemaking is expected to be issued later this year under Regulation Z, focused on disclosures for open-end credit accounts.

The revisions generally provide that an insured depository institution which fails or refuses to pay any assessment shall be subject to a penalty of not more than 1 percent of the assessment due for each day the violation continues. The statute provides for an exception if the failure to pay results from a dispute with the FDIC over the amount of the assessment and the institution deposits satisfactory security with the FDIC. A special statutory rule covering assessment amounts of less than $10,000 authorizes penalties up to $100 per day. The FDIC is accorded discretion to compromise, modify or remit any penalty imposed on a finding that good cause prevented timely payment. The FDIC proposes amending its rule concerning late assessment penalties in conformity with these provisions of the Reform Act. The proposed rule would incorporate these statutory provisions into the FDIC's regulations in place of the existing late assessment penalty rule at 12 CFR 308.132(c)(3)(v).",2006-07-19,"['Administrative practice and procedure', 'Bank deposit insurance', 'Banks, banking', 'Banks, banking', 'Banks, banking', 'Banks, banking', 'Claims', 'Crime', 'Equal access to justice', 'Fraud', 'Investigations', 'Lawyers', 'Penalties']"

See 60 FR 22156, 22177 (May 4, 1995). As part of our review, we published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) on July 19, 2001, seeking public comment on a wide range of questions. 66 FR 37602 (July 19, 2001). This proposal was developed following the agencies' review of the CRA regulations, which included an analysis of about four hundred comments received on the ANPR. The comments reflected a general consensus that fundamental elements of the regulations are sound, but indicated a profound split over the need for, and appropriate direction of, change. Community organizations advocated ``updating'' the regulations with expanded requirements to match developments in the industry and marketplace; financial institutions were concerned principally with reducing burden consistent with maintaining or improving the regulations' effectiveness. The agencies believe the regulations are essentially sound, but are in need of some updating to keep pace with changes in the financial services industry. Therefore, we are proposing amendments to the regulations in two areas. First, to reduce unwarranted burden consistent with the agencies' ongoing efforts to identify and reduce regulatory burden where appropriate and feasible, we are proposing to amend the definition of ``small institution'' to mean an institution with total assets of less than $500 million, without regard to any holding company assets. This change would take into account substantial institutional asset growth and consolidation in the banking and thrift industries since the definition was adopted. It also reflects the fact that small institutions with a sizable holding company do not appear to find addressing their CRA responsibilities any less burdensome than a similarly-sized institution without a sizable holding company. As described below, this proposal would increase the number of institutions that are eligible for evaluation under the small institution performance standards, while only slightly reducing the portion of the nation's bank and thrift assets subject to evaluation under the large retail institution performance standards. It would better align the definition of small institution with agency expectations when revising the regulations in 1995 about the scope of coverage for small institutions. Second, to better address abusive lending practices \1\ in CRA evaluations, we are proposing to amend our regulations specifically to provide that evidence that an institution, or any of an institution's affiliates, the loans of which have been considered pursuant to Sec. -- --.22(c), has engaged in specified discriminatory, illegal, or abusive credit practices in connection with certain loans adversely affects the evaluation of the institution's CRA performance. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------",2004-02-06,"['Banks, banking', 'Banks, banking', 'Banks, banking', 'Banks, banking', 'Community development', 'Credit', 'Investments', 'National banks', 'Reporting and recordkeeping requirements', 'Savings associations']"

As proposed to be amended, regulation 40.8(c) provided that: registered entities submitting material under parts 40 and 41 would be required to file a detailed written justification simultaneously with the request for confidential treatment; registered entities submitting material under parts 40 and 41 would be required to segregate material for which confidential treatment is requested in an appendix to the submission; and Commission staff may make an initial determination to grant or deny confidential treatment to such material before receiving a request under the FOIA. Regulation 40.8(c) is being reproposed to clarify that an initial determination by staff to deny confidential treatment may be appealed to the Commission's Office of General Counsel and that such an appeal will stay release of the material. The Commission believes these amendments, by creating a separate confidential treatment review process for filings under parts 40 and 41, will enhance the Commission's ability to provide the public with immediate access to non-confidential information. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------",2008-08-01,"['Commodity futures', 'Reporting and recordkeeping requirements']"

The final regulation would modify the current rule's requirements by: Making clear that an insured institution is required to file a ``certification'' when all of its deposits are assumed, but no certification is required if only a portion of its deposits are assumed; and requiring that the transferring institution, or its legal successor, file the certification rather than the assuming institution. The rule also clarifies that the transferring institution's status as an insured institution automatically terminates upon the FDIC's receipt of an accurate certification stating that: All of its deposits have been assumed by an insured depository institution or institutions, and the legal authority of the transferring institution to accept deposits has been terminated contemporaneously with the deposit assumption. In such a situation, and in a situation in which the FDIC has been appointed receiver of an insured institution, little practical purpose would be served by an order terminating deposit insurance, and the final rule provides that no such order will be issued in such situations. Finally, the rule would provide more specificity concerning how notice is given to depositors when an insured depository institution voluntarily terminates its insured status without the assumption of all of its deposits by an insured institution.

Under the current rules, a foreign private issuer may find it difficult to terminate its Exchange Act registration and reporting obligations despite the fact that there is relatively little interest in the issuer's U.S.- registered securities among United States investors. Moreover, currently a foreign private issuer can only suspend, and cannot terminate, a duty to report arising under section 15(d) of the Exchange Act. New Exchange Act Rule 12h-6 will permit a foreign private issuer of equity securities to terminate its reporting obligations under either section 13(a) or section 15(d) of the Exchange Act by meeting a quantitative benchmark designed to measure relative U.S. market interest for its equity securities that does not depend on a head count of the issuer's U.S. security holders. The new rule will permit a foreign private issuer to compare the average daily trading volume of its securities in the United States with its worldwide average daily trading volume, using a 5 percent benchmark. The accompanying rule amendments will also help provide U.S. investors with ready access through the Internet on an ongoing basis to material information about a foreign private issuer of equity securities that is required by its home country after it has exited the Exchange Act reporting system.

The new rule and amendments would continue to allow funds to bear promotional costs within certain limits, and would also preserve the ability of funds to provide investors with alternatives for paying sales charges (e.g., at the time of purchase, at the time of redemption, or through a continuing fee charged to fund assets). Unlike the current rule 12b-1 framework, the proposed rules would limit the cumulative sales charges each investor pays, no matter how they are imposed. To help investors make better- informed choices when selecting a fund that imposes sales charges, the Commission is also proposing to require clearer disclosure about all sales charges in fund prospectuses, annual and semi-annual reports to shareholders, and in investor confirmation statements. As part of the new regulatory framework, the Commission is proposing to give funds and their underwriters the option of offering classes of shares that could be sold by dealers with sales charges set at competitively established rates--rates that could better reflect the services offered by the particular intermediary and the value investors place on those services. For funds electing this option, the proposal would provide relief from restrictions that currently limit retail price competition for distribution services. The proposed rule and rule amendments are designed to protect individual investors from paying disproportionate amounts of sales charges in certain share classes, promote investor understanding of fees, eliminate outdated requirements, provide a more appropriate role for fund directors, and allow greater competition among funds and intermediaries in setting sales loads and distribution fees generally.",2010-08-04,"['Accounting', 'Investment companies', 'Reporting and recordkeeping requirements', 'Reporting and recordkeeping requirements', 'Reporting and recordkeeping requirements', 'Securities']"
